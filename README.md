# Food-Waste-Analyser
This my machine learning project of a food waste analsyer around the world. This project is a submission to the High School Big Data Challenge 2025, and in fact, my group and I progressed as the finalists out of Canada. Our research discovered quantifiable relationships between post-harvest food waste and the excessive use of pestice & fertilizer.
